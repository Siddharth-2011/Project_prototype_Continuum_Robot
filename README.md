# Project_prototype_Continuum_Robot
**Prototype of Continuum Robot**
This repository contains the prototype of a continuum robot, which was developed based on research papers and inspiration from biological trunks, tentacles, and snakes. The aim of this project is to explore the capabilities of continuum robots with redundant degrees of freedom and post-actuated devices in various applications, such as aerospace, nuclear facilities, and other narrow and multi-obstacle special environments.

**Overview**
Continuum robots have the ability to traverse confined spaces, manipulate objects in complex environments, and conform to curvilinear paths in space. They are inspired by natural structures like biological trunks, tentacles, and snakes. The development of this snake-inspired continuum robot is presented in this project.

**Hardware**
The prototype of the continuum robot utilizes the following hardware components:
**Johnson Motors:** These motors are used to provide the necessary actuation and movement for the robot's flexible structure.
**Arduino Uno:** The Arduino Uno serves as the microcontroller, providing control and communication between the motors and the robot's components.

**Repository Structure**
The repository is structured as follows:
/proposed design: This directory contains images the proposed design of the prototype.
/schematic: This directory contains images of the schematics of the prototype. 
/hardware: This directory contains the hardware images of the final model of the project.
/implementation design: This directory contains the image of the implementation design.
/project report final: This directory contains the extra documentation about the hardware components used along the applications, future scope and the references of the                              prototype.
/research paper: This directory contains the research paper which my teammates read before making our project.
/AI presentation: This directory contains the powerpoint presentation pertaining to this project.

Enjoy exploring the potential applications and possibilities of the continuum robot prototype!
